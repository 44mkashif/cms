## About the app
Actually, there are two separate apps. The Client which serves the FrontEnd (using React), and the Server (in Node/Express).

## Quick Start

``` bash
# Navigate to the server directory
cd server

# Install dependencies for server
npm install

# Install dependencies for client
npm run client-install

# Run the client & server with concurrently
npm run dev

# Run the Express server only
npm run server

# Run the React client only
npm run client

# Server runs on http://localhost:4000 and client on http://localhost:3000
```
